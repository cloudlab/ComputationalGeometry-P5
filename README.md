3D Geometry Library for Processing.org
------

This library provides Processing1 support for isometric contours and surfaces. These shapes are defined "implicitly", are representetative of threshold conditions within a gradient and can be realized at any level of detail. They are often used to represent heights in a topographic map, mesh reconstructions from MRI scans, proteins surface models and pressure lines in weather maps. This implementation works in a meta-ball modeling framework. Future releases will allow direct manipulation of the underlying value tensor, allowing for more flexibility.
 1 Processing.org is a framework for algorithmic visualization and computational sketching. It was created at the MIT Media Lab by Ben Fry and Casey Reas.
